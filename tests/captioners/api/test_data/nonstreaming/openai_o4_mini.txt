        "content": "A tight circular close-up shot frames a young raccoon’s face and one outstretched paw pressed against a translucent barrier. Its fur is a mix of dark grays and warm browns, with the characteristic black mask around wide, curious eyes that glisten with reflected light. The animal’s small, white-mottled snout and slightly parted mouth suggest a gentle, inquisitive expression. The perspective places the viewer directly opposite the raccoon, as if peering through a peephole or small window. Soft, even lighting from behind the barrier creates a gentle glow around the edges of its fur, while the background falls into deep shadow, drawing full attention to the raccoon’s features and the delicate texture of its whiskers.",
