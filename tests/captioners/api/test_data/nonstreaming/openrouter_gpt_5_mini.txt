The composition fills the frame with the raccoon’s face at a slight three-quarter angle, shot tightly from a low-to-eye-level perspective that emphasizes its glossy, reflective eyes and button nose. The image is a medium-tight close shot with a slight tilt, high contrast between the bright, diffused backlight inside the circular aperture and the deep shadowed fur, producing soft highlights on the whiskers and rim lighting along the head while the rest of the body falls into muted, warm-toned shadows; overall brightness is moderate with focused illumination on the face, conveying curious, yearning, and endearing emotions.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null,"reasoning_details":[{"type":"reasoning.encrypted","data":"ENCRYPTED_DATA","id":"REDACTED","format":"openai-responses-v1","index":0}]}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1373,"completion_tokens":269,"total_tokens":1642,"cost":0.00088125,"is_byok":false,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"cost_details":{"upstream_inference_cost":null,"upstream_inference_prompt_cost":0.00034325,"upstream_inference_completions_cost":0.000538},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":64,"image_tokens":0}}}
